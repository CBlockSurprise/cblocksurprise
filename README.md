# About Me

I like to code and make stuff, been doing it for about ~6 years (?), as of 2020.

# Languages

Currently, I can code in: Javascript (used with HTML and CSS, but I can also use it in NodeJS), Java (mostly use it to make plugins and mods for Minecraft), C# (mostly Unity), and Python. (I feel like I'm forgetting something.)
I'm always down to learn something new, every language usually have similarities so it doesn't get very hard for me.
